1. Copy, paste, and run the SQL code from the summary.
-CREATE TABLE practice_delete ( name TEXT, type TEXT, value INTEGER );
INSERT INTO practice_delete ( name, type, value ) VALUES ('delete', 'bronze', 50);
INSERT INTO practice_delete ( name, type, value ) VALUES ('delete', 'bronze', 50);
INSERT INTO practice_delete ( name, type, value ) VALUES ('delete', 'bronze', 50);
INSERT INTO practice_delete ( name, type, value ) VALUES ('delete', 'silver', 100);
INSERT INTO practice_delete ( name, type, value ) VALUES ('delete', 'silver', 100);
INSERT INTO practice_delete ( name, type, value ) VALUES ('delete', 'gold', 150);
INSERT INTO practice_delete ( name, type, value ) VALUES ('delete', 'gold', 150);
INSERT INTO practice_delete ( name, type, value ) VALUES ('delete', 'gold', 150);
INSERT INTO practice_delete ( name, type, value ) VALUES ('delete', 'gold', 150);

SELECT * FROM practice_delete;


2. Delete all `'bronze'` entries from the table.
